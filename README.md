# Computational Chemist Specializing in Machine Learning Methods for Biological Systems

Hi! I am a **computational chemist** with expertise in **machine learning** methods. My work is in developing a machine learning model called **LEGOLAS**. This method predicts protein NMR chemical shifts at rapid speeds, making it suitable for applications in ultra-large datasets and molecular dynamics trajectories.

## üî¨ Research Highlights

- **LEGOLAS Developer in the Roitberg Group**
    - Developed and trained a uniquely fast machine learning model, LEGOLAS (neuraL nEtwork enGine fOr caLculating chemicAl Shifts)
    - Optimized model accuracy by investigating various learning algorithms, encoding protein properties, and improving datasets
    - Applied LEGOLAS to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study chemical shift changes with protein folding and accurately determine binding modes in protein-peptide systems


- **ANI User in the Roitberg Group**
    - Computed interaction energies of DNA base pairs using deep learning model ANAKIN-ME (ANI)
    - Investigated canonical and non-canonical base pair stability
    - Evaluated two in-development models to better predict energies in unique nucleic acid states

## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Other Interests:

- **Surfing**
  - I have been surfing since I was 8 years old. During the summer seasons, I migrate north to teach surf lessons in Ocean City, NJ.
  - Since I am a bit landlocked now, I have taken up skateboarding. If I close my eyes and think about the ocean hard enough it's pretty close to the real deal...
 
- **Music & Art**
  - I play several musical instruments, including the piano, guitar, and ukulele.
  - I am also interested in art, with pen & ink and charcoal being my favorite mediums.
